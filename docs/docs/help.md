# Getting Help

Even the most experienced developer needs help on occasion. This page describes how you can get help and make progress.

## Asking for Help on Discord

**schwab-ts** has a vibrant community that hangs out in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/M3vjtHj). If you're having any sort of trouble, this server should be your first stop. Just make sure you follow a few rules to ask for help.

### Provide Adequate Information

Nothing makes it easier to help you than information. The more information you provide, the easier it'll be to help you. At the very least, you should provide the code you're using. If you're shy about your code, write a small test script to demonstrate the issue. Also, make sure you wrap your code in backticks to make it easier to read.

In addition to your code, it would really help if you shared:

1. **Your OS** (Windows? macOS? Linux?) and execution environment (VSCode? A raw terminal? A notebook? A Docker container in the cloud?)
2. **Your schwab-ts version**. You can see this by executing `console.log(require('schwab-ts/package.json').version)` in a Node.js shell. Make sure you're using the most recent version *before* asking for help. You can ensure this using `npm update schwab-ts`
3. **The full stack trace and error message**. Descriptions of errors will be met with requests to provide more information.

Optionally, you may want to share diagnostic logs generated by **schwab-ts**. Not only does this provide even more information to the community, reading through the logs might also help you solve the problem yourself. You can read about enabling logging [here](#enable-logging).

### Format Your Request Properly

Take advantage of Discord's wonderful support for code blocks and format your error, stack traces, and code using triple backticks. To do this, put ``````` before and after your message. Failing to do this will be met with a request to edit your message to be better formatted.

**Example:**
```
I'm getting this error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'get_accounts' of undefined
```

Here's my code:
```typescript
import { easyClient } from 'schwab-ts';

const client = await easyClient({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  appSecret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET',
  callbackUrl: 'https://127.0.0.1:8182',
  tokenPath: './token.json'
});

const accounts = await client.get_accounts(); // Error here
```
```

## Reporting a Bug

**schwab-ts** is not perfect. Features are missing, documentation may be out of date, and it almost certainly contains bugs. If you think of a way in which **schwab-ts** can be improved, we're more than happy to hear it.

This section outlines the process for getting help if you found a bug. If you need general help using **schwab-ts**, or just want to chat with other people interested in developing trading strategies, you can [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/M3vjtHj).

If you still want to submit an issue, we ask that you follow a few guidelines to make everyone's lives easier:

### Enable Logging

Behind the scenes, **schwab-ts** performs diagnostic logging of its activity. You can enable this debug information by configuring the logger:

```typescript
import { setLogLevel } from 'schwab-ts';

// Enable debug logging
setLogLevel('debug');

// Or enable request/response logging
import { enableRequestLogging } from 'schwab-ts';
enableRequestLogging();
```

Sometimes, this additional logging is enough to help you debug. Before you ask for help, carefully read through your logs to see if there's anything there that helps you.

### Gather Logs For Your Bug Report

If you still can't figure out what's going wrong, **schwab-ts** has special functionality for gathering and preparing logs for filing issues. It works by capturing **schwab-ts**'s logs, anonymizing them, and then dumping them to the console when the program exits. You can enable this by calling this method **before doing anything else in your application**:

```typescript
import { enableBugReportLogging } from 'schwab-ts';

// Enable bug report logging
enableBugReportLogging();
```

This method will redact the logs to scrub them of common secrets, like account IDs, tokens, access keys, etc. However, this redaction is not guaranteed to be perfect, and it is your responsibility to make sure they are clean before you ask for help.

When filing an issue, please upload the logs along with your description. **If you do not include logs with your issue, your issue may be closed**.

### Submit Your Ticket

You are now ready to write your bug report. Before you do, be warned that your issue may be closed if:

- **It does not include code**. The first thing we do when we receive your issue is we try to reproduce your failure. We can't do that if you don't show us your code.
- **It does not include logs**. It's very difficult to debug problems without logs.
- **Logs are not adequately redacted**. This is for your own protection.
- **Logs are copy-pasted into the issue message field**. Please write them to a file and attach them to your issue.
- **You do not follow the issue template**. We're not *super* strict about this one, but you should at least include all the information it asks for.

You can file an issue on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/tony-garand/schwab-ts/issues).

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication Issues

**Problem**: "Invalid client" or "Token expired" errors

**Solution**: 
- Tokens expire after 7 days
- Delete your old token file and create a new one
- Make sure you're using the correct API key and app secret

```typescript
// Delete old token and create new one
import { unlink } from 'fs/promises';
import { easyClient } from 'schwab-ts';

try {
  await unlink('./token.json');
} catch (error) {
  // Token file doesn't exist, that's fine
}

const client = await easyClient({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  appSecret: 'YOUR_APP_SECRET',
  callbackUrl: 'https://127.0.0.1:8182',
  tokenPath: './token.json'
});
```

### App Approval Issues

**Problem**: App stuck in "Approved - Pending" status

**Solution**:
- App approval can take several days
- Contact Schwab support if it's been more than a week
- Make sure your callback URL is exactly `https://127.0.0.1:8182` (no trailing slash)

### Import Errors

**Problem**: "Cannot find module 'schwab-ts'" errors

**Solution**:
- Make sure you've installed the package: `npm install schwab-ts`
- Check your Node.js version (requires 18+)
- Verify your TypeScript configuration

### Streaming Connection Issues

**Problem**: Streaming client won't connect

**Solution**:
- Check your authentication token
- Make sure you're calling `streamClient.login()` before subscribing
- Verify your account has streaming permissions

```typescript
import { StreamClient } from 'schwab-ts';

const streamClient = new StreamClient(client);
await streamClient.login(); // Don't forget this step!
await streamClient.level_one_equity_subs(['AAPL'], ['0', '1', '2']);
```

### Order Placement Issues

**Problem**: Orders being rejected

**Solution**:
- Check your account has sufficient funds
- Verify the symbol is valid and trading
- Make sure you have the correct permissions for the order type
- Check for market hours restrictions
